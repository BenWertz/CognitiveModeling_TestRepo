    "To figure out how many samples it takes for the empirical probabilities to match the theoretical values, we can calculate the standard deviation of the distribution for each scenario. Because each run of the simulation is independent and has the same probability of producing a given scenario, the number of occurrences of a scenario follows a binomial distribution $n\\sim\\operatorname{Bin}(N_{sim},p)$, with $N_{sim}$ being the number of draws and $p$ being the joint probability of the scenario. This distribution has expectation value $\\mathbb{E}[n]=pN_{sim}$ and standard deviation $\\operatorname{Var}[n]={N_{sim}p(1-p)}$. As such, the distribution of $p_{empirical}=n/N_{sim}$ has expectation value $\\mathbb{E}[p_{empirical}]=p$, and its standard deviation is $\\sigma_{p_{empirical}}=\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}[n]/N_{sim}}=\\sqrt{p(1-p)/N_{sim}}$. Note that if no probability is greater than 0.5 (which none of the joint probabilities are), increasing $p$ also increases the standard deviation. Thus, we should expect the most likely scenarios have empirical probabilities that deviate the most from the theoretical value, which does appear to be the case in the above table.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be confident that our empirical probabilities are 'almost indistinguishable' from the true probabilities to 4 decimal places, we need the standard deviation to be small enough that 'almost all' points fall within $(10^{-4})/2$ of the mean (so that it rounds to the same value). If we decide that 99.7% is a reasonable definition for 'almost all', the 68-95-99.7 rule suggests we need $3\\sigma\\leq 5\\cdot 10^{-5}$. Because higher-probability events have higher standard deviation, we should ensure this is true for the most likely outcome (`prisoner/teleporter-hack`, probability = 0.1330):\n",
